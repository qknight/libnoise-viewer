- scheduler now does not issue jobs at random but front-back instead which means that
  if you scroll the view in only one direction (but not backward to an area which has not
  been rendered jet) you will always get the latest area rendered first.

- the QGraphicsView is not at it's full size right from the beginning so the
    emit resetTilesSignal(graphicsView->sceneRect());
  does not work properly
  FIXED with mainWidget.cpp
    // if the initial screen is bigger (shows white zones) increase
    // this scene rect, could be done dynamically...
    scene->setSceneRect(QRectF(-400,-400,800,800));
- FIXED octave/frequency should be used and stored in settings
- FIXED used QGraphicsItems are not displayed
- FIXED settings are currently not stored correctly
- graphicsview vs view. one of these moves faster and so the view moves out of sight which is bad
  FIXED: the events which previously moved the QGraphicsView now are in absolute coordinates
           (not relatives) so this is no problem anymore
- view should center of 'scene' center
  FIXED: resizeEvent now set's the QGraphicsView to look at x,y=0,0
         there is now a resize issue, since a resize will currently reset the views position
         to 0,0 which is not wanted...

 - BUG: the graphicsview is smaller than the area it visualizes?!
   how to reproduce:
    - compile last commit (not this one)
    - start the program
    - use the cursor keys, it will be able to move the graphicsView some pixels
   FIXED with: 
   void movableGraphicsView::resizeEvent ( QResizeEvent * event ) {
      setSceneRect(QRect(0, 0, width()-6, height()-6));
