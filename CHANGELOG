 - BUG: the graphicsview is smaller than the area it visualizes?!
   how to reproduce:
    - compile last commit (not this one)
    - start the program
    - use the cursor keys, it will be able to move the graphicsView some pixels
   FIXED with: 
   void movableGraphicsView::resizeEvent ( QResizeEvent * event ) {
      setSceneRect(QRect(0, 0, width()-6, height()-6));
