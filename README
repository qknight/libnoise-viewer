this qt4 based project visualizes libnoise graphs.

author: joachim schiele <js adt lastlog doddt de>

libnoise graphs are a set of noise modules which are composed into an image. this
project not only displays a single image but gives you the impression you are
watching a planetary surface using a camera in a satelite.

it is interesting to see the scale of complex surface resulting from combinding
simple modules even in the most basic setup.

this project will later be included in one of my other projects, found here:
