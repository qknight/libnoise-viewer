known bugs/issues:
- kill threads: disable jobs which are not needed anymore  [bug]
- give job by reference not by value (object copy)
- render the viewrect only. disable renderjobs outside it
- increase importance of renderjobs inside the viewBox
- remove all TODOs
- switching from back/white to color sometimes leaves black/white tiles on the QGraphicsScene since jobs
  aren't canceled on change as well, so:
  - first cancel all pending jobs
  - next change the color

  // TODO make sceneWidth dynamic in boundaries
- QTimeLine for smooth scrolling
- remove prerender images from scene (right now they are just hidden)

question:
 - can the frequency be changed without loosing current x/y position outside the center?
  - known as 'zoom issue': when zooming in the x coordinate is misplaced for some reason?!
