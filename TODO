- kill threads: disable jobs which are not needed anymore  [bug]
- give job by reference not by object copy
- render the viewrect only. disable renderjobs outside it
- increase importance of renderjobs inside the viewBox
- remove all TODOs
  // TODO make sceneWidth dynamic in boundaries
- QTimeLine for smooth scrolling
- remove prerender images from scene (right now they are just hidden)
- zoom issue: when zooming in the x coordinate is misplaced for some reason?!
