known bugs/issues:
- remove objects properly, right now a lot of memory is wasted since no delete is used
- render the viewrect only. disable renderjobs outside it
    - only render tiles which: 
      - are below the view
      - are 1/width or 1/height out of the view
    - discard all scene items which are
      - are 1/width or 1/height out of the view
    - discard preview tiles after high quality tile is finished
- give job by reference not by value (object copy)
- increase importance of renderjobs inside the viewBox
- remove prerender images from scene (right now they are just hidden)
- kill threads: disable jobs which are not needed anymore
- switching from back/white to color sometimes leaves black/white tiles on the QGraphicsScene since jobs
  (read active threads) aren't canceled 'onChange' as well, so:
  - first cancel all pending jobs
  - next change the color
- remove all TODOs
- remove all FIXMEs

===================== misc issues ===================================
- harddrive access on scrolling using the mouse?!
- opengl acceleration?
- in qt4.5.x i get white borders in the rendering using the qgraphicsview, however they disappear if i 
  move the view via mouse click and drag

question:
 - can the frequency be changed without loosing current x/y position outside the center?
   known as 'zoom issue': when zooming in the x coordinate is misplaced for some reason?!
   FIX could be done with the noise::module::TranslatePoint module
