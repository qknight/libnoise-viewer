known bugs/issues:
- the graphicsview is smaller than the area it visualizes?!
- graphicsview vs view. one of these moves faster and so the view moves out of sight which is bad

- opengl acceleration?
- in qt4.5.x i get white borders in the rendering using the qgraphicsview, however they disappear if i 
  move the view via mouse click and drag
- kill threads: disable jobs which are not needed anymore
- give job by reference not by value (object copy)
- render the viewrect only. disable renderjobs outside it
- increase importance of renderjobs inside the viewBox
- switching from back/white to color sometimes leaves black/white tiles on the QGraphicsScene since jobs
  aren't canceled on change as well, so:
  - first cancel all pending jobs
  - next change the color

  // TODO make sceneWidth dynamic in boundaries
- remove prerender images from scene (right now they are just hidden)
- implement mouse-wheel-zooming
question:
 - can the frequency be changed without loosing current x/y position outside the center?
  - known as 'zoom issue': when zooming in the x coordinate is misplaced for some reason?!

- only render tiles which: 
  - are below the view
  - are 1/width or 1/height out of the view
- discard all scene items which are
  - are 1/width or 1/height out of the view
- discard preview tiles after high quality tile is finished

- remove all TODOs
